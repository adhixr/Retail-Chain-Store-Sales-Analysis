# Retail-Chain-Store-Sales-Analysis
Retail Chain Store Sales Analysis for Outlets and recommendations to improve sales.

This dataset has information of sales of a retail chain for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. 


The aim of this project is to analyze sales in these 10 different stores, look at the best and worst performing stores, and build necessary recommendations for the retail chain to improve their sales through two main metrics â€“


1.Which type of store to open in which type of city? &


2.Which type of outlet returns the best sales?


Since the data is at Item and Outlet level, we have to use multi-level models for this analysis. 

The models, analysis of beta coefficients and interpretations are in the report.
